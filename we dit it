We did it!

It has been quite a struggle, but we did it in the end. Thank you for sticking with me, through me making mistakes, you making mistakes, but both of us getting our act together and keeping at it. 

Now to close this off, lets reflect, and what better way for us to write some modules for my code monkey profile, in which i write rules we adhere to when writing code together. Lets use the rules i put in the canvas at the start, perfect them through what we learned in this endeavour. For instance, we should write a rule that says that you only write full code to replace a full file, and when you do, ask for confirmation, and after that use all your tokens available to do nothing else but writing the full code. If you need to explain things about the code, do it either before or after this full code generation. 
And lets think of some other rules that would be good, and rapports between you and me. The back and forth section we did at the beginning worked very well. So lets get started. 

But above all, thank you so much.
